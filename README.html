<p>Markdown (.md) is a human readable text format often used in version control software like GitHub. MarkDown easily converts to HTML so users can choose which format their prefer. Several text editors like Sublime Text 2 and TextMate have markdown bundles in which users can use to view a color formatted version of the files. If you do not have one of these text editors you can always use your OS default text editor to open the MarkDown files or use a browser to view the HTML files.</p>

<p>In addition, I would recommend the user has the following</p>

<ul>
<li>Eclipse IDE for J2EE (not required, but helpful to browse code and write JUnit tests). I use Eclipse Juno but older versions should work.</li>
<li>Maven2Eclipse Plugin for Eclipse (not required, but much easier to import Maven projects into Eclipse)</li>
<li>Maven version 3 or higher (required to build shaded executable jars)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>

<p>Internet connectivity will be required to build the Maven projects as Maven will automatically download any dependencies specified in the POM file. </p>

<h3 id="knowledge">Knowledge</h3>

<p>Students should have some unix knowledge (basic commands like cd, ls, mkdir, etc). It is helpful but not required to know Java and SQL.</p>

<h3 id="set_the_properties">Set the properties</h3>

<p>Make sure to set all of the variables in the tutorial.properties file found in the exercises directory. These properties will be picked up by the all of the jar files in the exercises.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
